# Calculator

This is a project proposed in the  [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com/) curriculum.
The calculator operates as close to the calculator apps found on phones/computers as I could achieve.

## Features
- All basic operations are supported (divide, multiple, add and subtract).
- Can use period (.) for floating point calculations.
- Has buttons to delete individual characters or clear the whole display.

## Notes
I had a hard time understanding how to make every functiolity work in the right order, in the end it seems like everything
is working properly, but I might need to refactor some bits and pieces.
